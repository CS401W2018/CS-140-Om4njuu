        <h3>1. Link to an outside website with an absolute link.</h3>
        <p>Devotional Tomorrow: <a href="https://speeches.byuh.edu/devotional-executive-committee-of-byu-hawaiis-board-of-trustees-2025-01-28">Click here</a></p>
        
        <h3>2. Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An absolute link is a hyperlink that contains the full URL to a webpage, including something like "http://" and domain name.</li>
            <li>A relative link only specifies the path to a page within the same domain/folder, without the full URL (relying on the current page's location to find the target page).</li>
            <li>The reason I would use relative link is because I don't need to come back and edit the link if the page
                is updated in the future (no techically required).
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3. Link to another engagement assignment (something in the activity folder).</h3>
        <p> Click <a href="structural_tags.html">here</a> to go to Structural Tags.</p>

        <h3>4. List the 3 rules with relative links.</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Have to be in the same folder/domain, then use the file name, for example, file.html</li>
            <li>If you want to access a file in a subdir, you have to specify the dir path after the filename, for example, folder/file.html</li>
            <li>If you want to nav up to diff folder (not sub folder), use ".." then slash, for example, ../previous-page.html or ../folder/previous-page.html</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>5. Link to your last project.</h3>
        <p> Click <a href="../projects/myInterest/favband.html">here</a> to go to My Interest.</p>

        <h3>6. Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h3>
        <p>Nope, you can do it anywhere you want.</p>
