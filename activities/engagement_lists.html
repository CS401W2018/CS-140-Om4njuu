    <h2>What are special entity characters?</h2>
        <p>Special entity characters in HTML are characters that can't be easily typed
            into a keyboard or may cause a browser to display incorrectly. They are
            typed in a sequences of characters that begin with an ampersand (&) 
            and end with a semicolon (;).</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> &lt; (greater than) type as <strong>&amp;lt;</strong></li>
            <li> &gt; (less than) type as <strong>&amp;gt;</strong></li>
            <li> &amp; (ampersand) type as <strong>&amp;amp;</strong></li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>What are phrase tags?</h2>
    <p>A phrase tag can be used inside another tag to change the style 
        of the text and it also used to tell the structural meaning 
        of a block of text. </p>
    
    <h2>What is the difference between OL and UL Tags?</h2>
    <p>OL is ordered list which when we make a list, it will be either
        ordered in numerical order or alphabetical order.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>First</li>
        <li>Second</li>
        <li>Third</li>
    </ol>
    <p>UL is for unordered list which when we make a list, it will be bulleted.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First</li>
        <li>Second</li>
        <li>Third</li>
    </ul>
