        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>I have been interested in creating video games since I was a kid. My mom and my dad 
            used to play video games together with me and my sister when I was a kid. So, I grew up
            love playing video games and I have a dream to make my own video games one day!~</p>
        
        <h2>What and Why I Love About Video Games</h2>
        <p>I love how video games can take you to a different world and let you experience things 
            that you can't do in real life. I also love how video games can bring people together 
            and create a community of people who share the same interests.</p>

        <h2>About Me Link</h2>
        <p>An absolute link is a hyperlink that contains the full URL to a webpage, including something like "http://" and domain name.</p>
        <p>A relative link only specifies the path to a page within the same domain/folder, without the full URL (relying on the current page's location to find the target page).</p>
