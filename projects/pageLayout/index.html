            <h3><span>Physiology</span></h3>
            <p>Paolumu is a cool monster that looks kind of like a bat, especially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduran_white_bat">Honduran white bat</a>, 
                which is a tiny bat with white fur and a pink face. Paolumu has white fur too, and its face 
                is also pink! But it's not all fluffy, it has some brown scales on its back, belly, and tail. 
                It has these funny teeth that stick out, like a beaver or a rat! That's because it loves to 
                eat eggs from the coral. It uses its super strong breath to suck those eggs right up! 
                If hunters want to fight it, they can hurt its head, wings, or tail to weaken it.</p>

            <br>
            
            <h3><span>Behavior and Abilities</span></h3>
            <p>Paolumu is like a fluffy, flying monster with a super cool 
                trick! Inside its neck, it has a special balloon-like bag 
                that fills up with air when it breathes in really hard. 
                Once that bag is full, Paolumu can float up in the air, 
                just like a balloon! When it's floating, it can swoop down 
                and attack enemies from above. It also has a strong, 
                hard tail that it uses to whack anything that gets too close.</p>
            <p>Paolumu can also blow really strong wind at its enemies or 
                suck them in closer with its powerful breath. If hunters 
                want to stop it from floating, they can climb onto its back 
                or hit its neck to make the air bag deflate.</p>
            <p>Paolumu is usually pretty chill and won't bother anyone 
                unless someone bothers it first. But if it feels threatened, 
                it gets super angry and starts fighting back.</p>
